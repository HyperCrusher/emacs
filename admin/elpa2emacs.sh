# This code merges an ELPA package that lives in a branch of
# https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs/elpa.git into the Emacs repo.
#
# It attempts to do the following things:
#
# - Move mentioned files to benchmarks/ (modify this if you need a
#   different root)
#
# - Preserve complete history from original repo for the files

# Dependencies required
#
# - https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo
#    nix shell nixpkgs#git-filter-repo
#    arch: pacman -S git-filter-repo
# - git

# Repos will be cloned in this directory if they don't exist already.
# No repo updates will be performed automatically.
#
# It is recommended to create a worktree of the Emacs repo (but not the
# ELPA one!) here.  This can be done by moving on to any existing emacs
# worktree and typing:
#
#   git worktree add /path-to-this-files-directory/emacs scratch/elpa2emacs
#
# If you want to avoid another ELPA checkout, you can copy an existing
# checkout to the elpa subdirectory of this directory, but you shouldn't
# use a worktree as the repo itself will be destructively modified.
#
# If (when) things go sour, this normally helps:
#
#   rm -rf elpa # will be recloned
#   cd emacs
#   git merge --abort
#   cd ../
#
# Run like this:
#
#   bash -x ./elpa2emacs.sh externals/elisp-benchmarks elisp-benchmarks.el benchmarks resources
#
